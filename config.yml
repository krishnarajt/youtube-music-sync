# YouTube Playlist Downloader Configuration

# Operating System: "windows" or "linux"
# This helps the script handle path separators and executables correctly
os_type: "windows"  # Options: "windows" or "linux"

# Input method: Choose either 'channel', 'playlist_urls', or 'playlist_file'
input_method: "playlist_file"  # Options: "channel", "playlist_urls", or "playlist_file"

# For channel method: YouTube channel URL
# (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/@channelname or https://www.youtube.com/c/channelname)
# Note: This works for regular YouTube channels but NOT YouTube Music channels
channel_url: "https://music.youtube.com/@KrishnarajThadesar-ud9ji"

# For playlist_urls method: List of direct playlist URLs
# Can be from YouTube, YouTube Music, or mix of both
playlist_urls:
  - "https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUvscRyjXlgswZZ3SzDszFiGNxTFypb0t"
  - "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=ANOTHER_PLAYLIST_ID"
  # Add more playlist URLs here

# For playlist_file method: Path to a text file containing playlist URLs (one per line)
# This is useful if you have many playlists - just paste all URLs into a text file
# The script will automatically extract playlist IDs from any YouTube/YouTube Music URLs
playlist_file: "playlists.txt"

# Root directory where playlists will be downloaded
# Each playlist will be saved in a subdirectory named after the playlist
# Windows example: "C:/Music/YouTube" or "C:\\Music\\YouTube"
# Linux example: "/home/user/Music/YouTube" or "~/Music/YouTube"
root_path: "C:\\Users\\Krishnaraj\\Downloads\\testing_youtube_music_downloader"

# Path to yt-dlp executable
# Windows example: "C:/Tools/yt-dlp.exe" or just "yt-dlp" if in PATH
# Linux example: "/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp" or just "yt-dlp" if in PATH
ytdlp_path: "P:\\programs\\python\\youtube-music-sync\\yt-dlp.exe"

# Path to ffmpeg executable (required for audio conversion)
# Windows example: "C:/Tools/ffmpeg.exe" or just "ffmpeg" if in PATH
# Linux example: "/usr/bin/ffmpeg" or just "ffmpeg" if in PATH
ffmpeg_path: ""  # Leave empty if ffmpeg is in PATH

# Audio format for downloaded files
# IMPORTANT: Use "best" not "auto" - "auto" is not recognized by yt-dlp
# Options: "best", "mp3", "flac", "wav", "m4a", "opus", "vorbis", "aac"
audio_format: "best"  # Changed from "auto" to "best"

# Audio quality (0 = best quality)
# For MP3: 0 (best) to 9 (worst), or bitrate like "320K"
# For other formats: 0 (best) to 10 (worst)
audio_quality: "0"

# Optional: Additional yt-dlp arguments (advanced users)
# These are already included in the script, but you can add more here
